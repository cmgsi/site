TODO:

* Export a standalone HTML
* Fix layout issues
* Save screenshot
* Paste CSV
* Choose border sizes (small, medium, large, auto?)
* Reloading currently load file?
* Choice of which weight and color column to use
  * Some simple weight->weight and number->color functions?
* Extra column types for things that can be customized through decorators
  (fill opacity, label color, font and opacity).
* Possibility to paste a JSON with additional FoamTree options. This would override the non-advanced
  options like border size slider.
* View properties of selected groups in a special panel?
